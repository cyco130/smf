# SMF - Build Your Own Metaframework with Vite

Recently, in [one of my tweets](https://twitter.com/cyco130/status/1699768992309617108), I claimed that building a metaframework (a.k.a. a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) clone ðŸ˜…) with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) is easy. This article is an attempt to prove that somewhat bold claim by creating a reasonably usable [Preact](https://preactjs.com)[^1] metaframework called SMF. SMF may stand for either "Simple MetaFramework" or [the name of the fan club of Twisted Sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDpO8OKHzk8), my favorite band in my teenage years. You decide.

In this article, I will be assuming that you are reasonably familiar with Preact, Vite, and the concept of server-side rendering (SSR). I will use `pnpm` but it's not a requirement. You can use `npm` or `yarn` if you prefer.

[^1]: The reason I picked Preact is that there doesn't seem to be a good Vite-based Preact metaframework as of yet.

## 01. Project setup

I started with the following files:

`.gitignore`

```gitignore
node_modules
dist
```

`package.json`

```json
{
  "name": "smf",
  "private": true,
  "type": "module"
}
```

`tsconfig.json`

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "target": "es2022",
    "module": "ESNext",
    "esModuleInterop": true,
    "forceConsistentCasingInFileNames": true,
    "strict": true,
    "skipLibCheck": true,
    "moduleResolution": "Bundler",
    "resolveJsonModule": true,
    "jsx": "react-jsx",
    "jsxImportSource": "preact"
  }
}
```

I also copied my `.prettierrc` from another project. Omitted here for brevity.

Then I installed the dependencies.

```sh
pnpm i -S preact preact-render-to-string
pnpm i -D prettier vite @preact/preset-vite @types/node
```

Since we're using a single repo, the code for SMF and the code for the example app will live side by side. The `src` directory will contain the example app and the `smf` directory will contain the code for SMF. SMF will be a set of Vite plugins. Here's the initial version:

`smf/smf.ts`

```ts
import type { Plugin } from "vite";

export function smf(): Plugin[] {
  // A list of plugins, empty for now
  return [];
}
```

And the initial Vite config:

`vite.config.ts`

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "vite";
import { smf } from "./smf";
import { preact } from "@preact/preset-vite";

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [smf(), preact()],
});
```

Finally, I added a `dev` script to `package.json`:

```
  "type": "module",
+ "scripts": {
+   "dev": "vite"
+ },
  "dependencies": {
```

Now we can run `pnpm dev` and see that Vite is working. It will start serving our "app" on `localhost:5173` but you'll get a 404 since we haven't created an app yet.

## 02. Using `ssrLoadModule` to run server code

[Vite's own SSR guide](https://vitejs.dev/guide/ssr.html) recommends using Vite in "middleware mode". If we followed it, we would use `vite.createServer` with `{ server: { middlewareMode: true } }` to create a Vite development middleware, then create a Node server with, e.g. Express, and add the Vite middleware to it. Then we would use `viteDevServer.ssrLoadModule` to load our server code.

This flow poses a chicken-and-egg problem if we want to use TypeScript or JSX: We need Vite's dev server to compile our server code but we need the server code to create the Vite middleware. We could use a separate tool like `ts-node` but to me, it doesn't make sense to use a separate tool when Vite is already there. This approach also requires us to give up on Vite's CLI and handle all options ourselves. That's not ideal.

To solve this, we will take the recommended flow and turn it around: Instead of using Vite as a middleware in our server, we will use our server code as a middleware in Vite's dev server. Vite plugins can define a [`configureServer`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-plugin.html#configureserver) hook to hook into Vite's dev server. We will use it to load our server code with the `ssrLoadModule` method of the [Vite dev server](https://vitejs.dev/guide/api-javascript.html#vitedevserver) and inject it as a middleware. Vite uses `connect` under the hood, you can think of it as Express minus the router. We can add a middleware with `server.middlewares.use` just like adding an Express middleware. Here's how, read the comments for details:

`smf/smf.ts`

```ts
import type { Plugin } from "vite";

export function smf(): Plugin[] {
  return [
    {
      name: "smf/load-handler",
      enforce: "post",
      apply: "serve",
      configureServer(server) {
        // Instead of adding the middleware here, we return a function that Vite
        // will call after adding its own middlewares. We want our code to run after
        // Vite's transform middleware so that we can focus on handling the requests
        // we're interested in.
        return () => {
          server.middlewares.use(async (req, res, next) => {
            try {
              const handlerModule = await server.ssrLoadModule(
                // This is where we'll put our handler
                server.config.root + "/src/entry-handler.ts",
                {
                  // This is required to make errors thrown in the handler
                  // to have the correct stack trace.
                  fixStacktrace: true,
                },
              );

              await handlerModule.default(req, res);

              // We're not calling `next` because our handler will always be
              // the last one in the chain. If it didn't send a response, we
              // will treat it as an error since there will be no one else to
              // handle it in production.
              if (!res.writableEnded) {
                next(new Error("SSR handler didn't send a response"));
              }
            } catch (error) {
              // Forward the error to Vite
              next(error);
            }
          });
        };
      },
    },
  ];
}
```

And our first handler will look like this:

`src/entry-handler.ts`

```ts
import type { RequestListener } from "node:http";

const handler: RequestListener = async (req, res) => {
  // res.send is not available in plain Node.js, it's added by Express.
  // We have to use res.write and/or res.end instead.
  res.end(`Received a ${req.method} request to ${req.url}.`);
};

export default handler;
```

If you run `pnpm dev` now, you should see the following output in the browser:

```txt
Received a GET request to /index.html.
```

That's weird. We requested `/` but Vite rewrote it to `/index.html` when its transform middleware couldn't find anything to serve. We don't want that, we need to set Vite's [`appType`](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#apptype) configuration option to `"custom"` to tell Vite that we will be serving our own dynamically generated HTML, not an `index.html` file from the file system. We could set it in `vite.config.ts` but that file belongs to the user. We should do it in our plugin's `config` hook instead so that when the user adds our plugin, they don't have to worry about it:

`smf/smf.ts`

```
      apply: "serve",
+     config() {
+       return {
+         appType: "custom",
+       };
+     },
      configureServer(server) {
```

Now visiting `localhost:5173/` should give us the expected output:

```txt
Received a GET request to /.
```

If you change the handler code and refresh the page, you will see the changes reflected (we will cover automatic reloading and HMR later). It works because `ssrLoadModule` will invalidate its cache when a file or its dependencies change. This is not exactly hot module replacement (HMR), which Vite doesn't support for server code yet, but it's similar in that it allows us to change the code and see the changes without restarting the server.

This exact "the app as middleware" trick is used by many Vite-based metaframeworks such as [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev), [Astro](https://astro.build), [SolidStart](https://start.solidjs.com), and [Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io). My [vavite](https://github.com/cyco130/vavite) package, a set of tools for developing and building server-side applications with Vite that [Rakkas](https://rakkasjs.org) uses under the hood, makes it even easier and solves a bunch of other challenges we will face later. Ordinarily, I would start with `vavite` and skip this section and several others but I promised a "from scratch" tutorial so here we are.

Some other metaframeworks (most notably [Nuxt](https://nuxt.com)) use [`vite-node`](https://github.com/vitest-dev/vitest/tree/main/packages/vite-node) which is currently part of the Vitest project but it is expected to be [merged into Vite core](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/pull/12165) in the future. It is more difficult to set up but it has additional features like customizable HMR behavior and the ability to run Vite's server and the app code in separate VM contexts or processes. Nevertheless, we will stick with our simpler approach that has been proven to be more than adequate by so many successful metaframeworks.
